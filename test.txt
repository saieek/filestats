In the context of authentication, the terms "stateless" and "stateful" refer to the way authentication information is handled between the client (user agent) and the server.

Stateless Authentication:
In stateless authentication, each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed for the server to understand and verify the request.
The server does not store any information about the client's authentication state between requests. Each request is treated independently.
Stateless authentication is often achieved using tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or API keys. The client includes the token with each request, and the server verifies the token's integrity to authenticate the user.
Advantages:
Scalability: No need to store session information on the server, making it easier to scale horizontally.
Independence: Each request contains all necessary information, reducing the need for server-side storage.
Disadvantages:
Token size: Tokens may contain redundant information, potentially leading to larger payloads.
Revocation: Revoking access before token expiration can be challenging.
Stateful Authentication:
In stateful authentication, the server keeps track of the client's authentication state on the server side.
Typically, a session identifier or token is associated with the client's session on the server. This session identifier is often stored in cookies on the client side and sent with each request.
The server uses the session identifier to look up the user's authentication state on each request.
Advantages:
Revocation: It is easier to revoke access by invalidating the session on the server.
Smaller tokens: Since the server manages the session state, the client-side token can be smaller.
Disadvantages:
Scalability: Server-side storage of session information can be challenging to scale, especially in distributed or microservices architectures.
Complexity: Managing server-side sessions introduces additional complexity and potential points of failure.
The choice between stateless and stateful authentication often depends on the specific requirements of the application, scalability considerations, and the desired trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility. Many modern web applications and APIs use stateless authentication, leveraging tokens for authentication, while some traditional web applications still rely on stateful authentication using sessions and cookies.
